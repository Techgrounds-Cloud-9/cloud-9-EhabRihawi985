### Overcome challenges
N/A

### Results
* Exercise 1:
1. Create a new script.
2. Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
3. Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

* Exercise 2:
1. Create a new script.
2. Copy the code below into your script.
 for i in range(10):
    # do something here
3. Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
4. Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
5. Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

* Exercise 3:
1. Create a new script.
2. Copy the array below into your script.
    arr = ["Coen", "Casper", "Joshua", "Abdessamad", "Saskia"]
3. Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.
