# [Key-value pairs]
[Key-value pairs are a general concept you will definitely encounter. Some examples of where you will find them are NoSQL databases or AWS resource tags. Dictionaries (dict) in Python also use key-value pairs to store information.]

## Key terminology
**Dictionary**
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

**Dictionary Items**
Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

### Overcome challenges
[Give a short description of the challeges you encountered, and how you solved them.]

### Results
* Exercise 1:
1. Create a new script.
2. Create a dictionary with the following keys and values:

    | Key | Value |
    | First name | Casper |
    | Last name | Velzen |

* Exercise 2:
1. Create a new script.
2. Use user input to ask for their information (first name, last name, job title, company). Store the information in a dictionary.
3. Write the information to a csv file (comma-separated values). The data should not be overwritten when you run the script multiple times.
