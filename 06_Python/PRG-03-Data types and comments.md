# [Data types and comments]
[Under the hood, a computer can only see strings of zeros and ones. Programming languages make use of data types to tell the computer how to interpret those strings.]

[Comments are lines that do not get processed as code.]

## Key terminology
**Boolean**
A binary state that is either True or False.

**string**
Technically an array of characters. Strings are denoted using “ ” double quotes or ‘ ’ single quotes.

**int**
An integer is a whole number. Ints can be both positive and negative.

**float**
A floating-point number is a decimal number.

### Overcome challenges
N/A

### Results
Exercise 1:
* Create a new script.
* Copy the code below into your script.
    a = 'int'
    b = 7
    c = False
    d = "18.5"
* Determine the data types of all four variables (a, b, c, d) using a built in function.
* Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.
* Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.

Exercise 2:
* Create a new script.
* Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
* Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
