# Exercise 2:
## Create a new script.
## Write a custom function myfunction() that prints “Hello, world!” to the terminal. Call myfunction.
## Rewrite your function so that it takes a string as an argument. Then, it should print “Hello, <string>!”.

# Exercise 3:
## Create a new script.
## Copy the code below into your script.
    def avg():
        # write your code here
 
    x = 128
    y = 255
    z = avg(x,y)
## print ("The average of",x,"and", y, "is", z)
## Write the custom function avg() so that it returns the average of the given parameters.
