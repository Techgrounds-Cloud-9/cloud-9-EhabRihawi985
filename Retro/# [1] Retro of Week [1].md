# [1] Retro of Week [1]

## What went well?
(Ehab)
 - Collaboration went good 
 - Team work went good   
 - Finding the answers went good

(Daphne)
 - Time managment went well, at day 2 I had a good indication of when I would finish certain tasks. 
This way I knew when to move on to the next assignment.


(Tanuja)
 - The team had a good time working together.


(Manisha)
 - We did use pomodoro technique, partially!
 - Being the first week, there were several things to do and follow. It took little longer to adjust everything in the schedule.
 - Also had a technical issue

## What could have gone better?
(Ehab)
 - Documentation work done faster
 
(Daphne)
 - File management could be better, I think I'll have problems finding standup and retro files later on.

(Tanuja)
 - If i am organized with my files and search i did for my assingments link would  give more time to finish.

(Manisha)

## What can we do to improve?
(Ehab)
 - Managing the time by set a time to do documentation work.

(Daphne)
 - Making a new directory for standup and retro files specific.

(Tanuja)
- N/A

(Manisha)
- Discussing the issue at early stage and taking help from others to resolve.
