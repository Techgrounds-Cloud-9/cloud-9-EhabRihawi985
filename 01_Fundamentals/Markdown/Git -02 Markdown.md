# [Git en Markdown]
## Markdown :
Markdown is a lightweight plain text-based markup language designed to be easily converted to HTML and other formats with an application of the same name. 
Markdown is often used for formatting project documentation, simple CMS systems and posts in online forums.

## WYSIWYG vs WYSIWYM :
WYSIWYG : is a system in which editing software allows content to be edited in a form that resembles its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, 
such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation. WYSIWYG implies a user interface that allows the user to view something very similar to the end result while the document is being created. In general, WYSIWYG implies the ability to directly manipulate the layout of a document without having to type or remember names of layout commands.

WYSIWYM : usually offer a possibility to mark up content with style classes rather than directly saying how each letter, word or passage should look. 
(Kind of like using CSS classes instead of in-line CSS or FONT-tags.)
