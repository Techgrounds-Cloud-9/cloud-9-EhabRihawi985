1. De Azure principes voor kostenmanagement

These critical design principles are used as lenses to assess the Cost optimization of an application deployed on Azure. These lenses provide a framework for the application assessment questions.

* Choose the correct resources
Choose the right resources that are aligned with business goals and can handle the performance of the workload.

* Set up budgets and maintain cost constraints
Every design choice has cost implications. Consider the budget constraints set by the company, before choosing:
- An architectural pattern
- Azure service
- A price model for the service

* Dynamically allocate and de-allocate resources
To match performance needs, dynamically allocate and de-allocate resources.
Identify idle or underutilized resources through Azure Advisor or other tools, and:
- Reconfigure
- Consolidate
- (or) Shut down

* Optimize workloads, aim for scalable costs
A key benefit of the cloud is the ability to scale dynamically. The workload cost should scale linearly with demand. You can save cost through automatic scaling.

* Continuously monitor and optimize cost management
To provision resources dynamically and to scale with demand:
- Conduct regular cost reviews
- Measure capacity needs
- Forecast capacity needs

3. Het verschil tussen CAPEX en OPEX.
CapEx is an upfront fee to buy or improve a fixed asset. OpEx is ongoing spending necessary to keep a fixed asset running.
Capital expenditures (CapEx) are major purchases a company makes that are designed to be used over the long term. Operating expenses (OpEx) are the day-to-day expenses a company incurs to keep its business operational.
