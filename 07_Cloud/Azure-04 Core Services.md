### Results
1. Regions and Region Pairs
An Azure Region Pair is a relationship between 2 Azure Regions within the same geographic region for disaster recovery purposes. If one of the regions were to experience a disaster or failure, then the services in that region will automatically failover to that regions secondary region in the pair.

2. Availability Zones
Azure availability zones are physically and logically separated datacenters with their own independent power source, network, and cooling. Connected with an extremely low-latency network, they become a building block to delivering high availability applications.

3. Resource Groups
A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group

4. Subscriptions
An Azure subscription is a logical container used to provision related business or technical resources in Azure. It holds the details of all your resources like virtual machines (VMs), databases, and more. When you create an Azure resource like a VM, you identify the subscription it belongs to.

5. Management Groups
Management groups are containers that help you manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple subscriptions. Create these containers to build an effective and efficient hierarchy that can be used with Azure Policy and Azure Role Based Access Controls.

6. Azure Resource Manager
Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You use management features, like access control, locks, and tags, to secure and organize your resources after deployment.

7. Virtual Machines
An Azure virtual machine gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs it. However, you still need to maintain the virtual machine by performing tasks, such as configuring, patching, and installing the software that runs on it.

8. Azure App Services
Azure App Service lets you create apps faster with a one-of-a kind cloud service to quickly and easily create enterprise-ready web and mobile apps for any platform or device and deploy them on a scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure.

9. Azure Container Instances (ACI)
Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a managed service that allows you to run containers directly on the Microsoft Azure public cloud, without requiring the use of virtual machines (VMs).

10. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by offloading the operational overhead to Azure. As a hosted Kubernetes service, Azure handles critical tasks, like health monitoring and maintenance.

* What is Kubernetes and used for?
Kubernetes automates operational tasks of container management and includes built-in commands for deploying applications, rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your applications up and down to fit changing needs, monitoring your applications, and moreâ€”making it easier to manage applications.

11. Azure Virtual Desktop
Azure Virtual Desktops offer an easy and secure way to give your entire team secure access to the information and applications they need on their devices. This saves time, resources and boosts employee efficiency.

12. Virtual Networks
Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

13. VPN Gateway
Azure VPN Gateway is a cloud based network gateway that enables in connecting on-premises networks with Azure using site-to-site VPNs. Azure VPN Gateway provides secure connectivity by using industry standard protocols, IPsec and IKE to secure the connection.

14. Virtual Network Peering
Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more Virtual Networks in Azure. The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure.

15. ExpressRoute
ExpressRoute is an Azure service that lets you create private connections between Microsoft datacenters and infrastructure that's on your premises or in a colocation facility.

16. Container (Blob) Storage
Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

17. Disk Storage
Azure Disk Storage is the only shared cloud block storage that supports both Windows and Linux-based clustered or high-availability applications via Azure shared disks.

18. File Storage
Azure Files is a shared storage service that lets you access files via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, and mount file shares on Windows, Linux or Mac machines in the Azure cloud. You can also cache file shares in on-premises Windows Servers using the Azure File Sync agent.

19. Storage Tiers
Azure Storage access tiers include: Hot tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. The hot tier has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs. Cool tier - An online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified.

20. Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB is used extensively in Microsoft's own e-commerce platforms, that run the Windows Store and XBox Live. It is also used in the retail industry for storing catalog data and for event sourcing in order processing pipelines.

21. Azure SQL Database
Azure SQL Database is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) database engine that handles most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring without user involvement. 

22. Azure Database for MySQL
Azure Database for MySQL is a relational database service based on the MySQL Community Edition database engine, versions 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, and available in the Microsoft cloud. Azure MySQL Database provides the following features: Zone redundancy and high availability within the same zone.

23. Azure Database for PostgreSQL
Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service based on the open-source Postgres database engine. It's a fully managed database-as-a-service that can handle mission-critical workloads with predictable performance, security, high availability, and dynamic scalability.

24. SQL Managed Instance
Azure SQL Managed Instance is the intelligent, scalable cloud database service that combines the broadest SQL Server database engine compatibility with all the benefits of a fully managed and evergreen platform as a service.

25. Azure Marketplace
Azure Marketplace is an online store that contains thousands of IT software applications and services built by industry-leading technology companies. In Azure Marketplace you can find, try, buy, and deploy the software and services you need to build new solutions and manage your cloud infrastructure.
