### Results

1. The OSI model and its uses.
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.

the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

2. The TCP/IP model and its uses.
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. 
TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).
