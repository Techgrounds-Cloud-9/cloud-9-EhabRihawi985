# [NTW-01 OSI stack]
[OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.]

## Key terminology

**OSI Model**
The OSI model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.

**Physical Layer**
The physical layer defines the means of transmitting a stream of raw bits over a physical data link connecting network nodes.

**Data Link Layer**
The data link layer has two sublayers. One is the logical link control (LLC) sublayer, which essentially maintains the communications link between two devices on the network. The other is the media access control (MAC) sublayer which manages the transmission of data between two devices.

**Network Layer**
the part of the Internet communications process where these connections occur, by sending packets of data back and forth between different networks.

**Transport Layer**
The transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation and desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those that fail.

**Session Layer**
Session Layer is the layer of the ISO Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model that controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages, and terminates the connections between the local and remote application.

**Presentation Layer**
The presentation layer is the lowest layer at which application programmers consider data structure and presentation, instead of simply sending data in the form of datagrams or packets between hosts.

**Application Layer**
An application layer is an abstraction layer that specifies the shared communications protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a communications network.

**TCP/IP**
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices.

### Results

1. The OSI model and its uses.
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.

the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

2. The TCP/IP model and its uses.
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. 
TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).
