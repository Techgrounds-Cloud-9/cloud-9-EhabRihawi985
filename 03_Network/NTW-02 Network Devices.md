# [NTW-02 Network Devices]
[Network devices, or networking hardware, are physical devices that are required for communication and interaction between hardware on a computer network.]

## Key terminology

**Hub**
A hub is a physical layer networking device which is used to connect multiple devices in a network.

**Switch**
A switch is a device in a computer network that connects other devices together. Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices.

**Router**
A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.

**Bridge**
A bridge is a type of computer network device that provides interconnection with other bridge networks that use the same protocol. Bridge devices work at the data link layer of the Open System Interconnect (OSI) model, connecting two different networks together and providing communication between them.

**Gateway**
A computer that sits between different networks or applications. The gateway converts information, data or other communications from one protocol or format to another. A router may perform some of the functions of a gateway. An Internet gateway can transfer communications between an enterprise network and the Internet.

**Modem**
 a device that converts signals produced by one type of device  to a form compatible with another, There are three kinds of modems—Cable, DSL, and Fiber—that operate via different cable mediums depending on your Internet Service Provider (ISP)

**Repeater**
A repeater is an electronic device in a communication channel that increases the power of a signal and retransmits it, allowing it to travel further.

**Access Point**
An access point is a device that creates a wireless local area network, or WLAN, usually in an office or large building. An access point connects to a wired router, switch, or hub via an Ethernet cable, and projects a WiFi signal to a designated area.

1. Benoem en beschrijf de functies van veel voorkomend netwerkapparatuur.

- Hub:
A hub is a physical layer networking device which is used to connect multiple devices in a network. 
They are generally used to connect computers in a LAN. A hub has many ports in it. A computer which intends to be connected to the network is plugged in to one of these ports

- What is the purpose of hubs?
Hubs connect multiple computer networking devices together. A hub also acts as a repeater in that it amplifies signals that deteriorate after traveling long distances over connecting cables.
A hub is the simplest in the family of network connecting devices because it connects LAN components with identical protocols.

- switch:
is a device in a computer network that connects other devices together. Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices.

- What is switch used for?
Switches are key building blocks for any network. 
They connect multiple devices, such as computers, wireless access points, printers, and servers; on the same network within a building or campus. 
A switch enables connected devices to share information and talk to each other.

- A router:
is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. 
It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, 
and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.

- What is a router and how it works?
Routers connect computers and other devices to the Internet. A router acts as a dispatcher, choosing the best route for your information to travel. 
It connects your business to the world, protects information from security threats, and can even decide which computers get priority over others.

- Where are routers used?
A router is a switching device for networks, which is able to route network packets, based on their addresses, to other networks or devices. 
Among other things, they are used for Internet access, for coupling networks or for connecting branch offices to a central office via VPN (Virtual Private Network).

- A network bridge: 
is a computer networking device that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments. This function is called network bridging.

- What is bridge used for?
A bridge is a network device that connects multiple subnetworks to create a single network. It provides interconnection with other computer networks that use the same protocol. 
Through a bridge, multiple LANs can be connected to form a larger and extended LAN.

- Gateway:
A gateway device provides communication to a remote network or an autonomous system that is out of bounds for the host network nodes. 
Gateways serve as the entry and exit point of a network; all data routed inward or outward must first pass through and communicate with the gateway in order to use routing paths.

- What is a gateway used for?
The gateway converts information, data or other communications from one protocol or format to another. 
A router may perform some of the functions of a gateway. An Internet gateway can transfer communications between an enterprise network and the Internet.

- Is gateway and router are same?
A Router is a networking layer system used to manage and forward data packets to computer networks. A gateway is simply a device or hardware that acts as a "gate" between the networks. 
It could also be defined as a node that acts as an entry for other network nodes.

- What is a modem device?
modem, (from “modulator/demodulator”), 
any of a class of electronic devices that convert digital data signals into modulated analog signals suitable for transmission over analog telecommunications circuits.

- What is a modem and why is it used?
A modem transforms digital information from your computer into analog signals that can transmit over wires (and vice versa) 
by modulating and demodulating electrical impulses sent through phone lines, coaxial cables, or other types of wiring.

- There are three kinds of modems—Cable, DSL, and Fiber—that operate via different cable mediums depending on your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

- Routers and modems have traditionally been two separate devices that worked together to form your home network. However, with today's technology, you don't need a separate modem and separate router necessarily, as new combination modem and router units merge the two devices' functions into one powerful gadget.

- Repeater: 
is a device that receives a digital signal on an electromagnetic or optical transmission medium and regenerates the signal along the next leg of the medium.
Repeaters are used to extend transmissions

- An access point: 
is a device that creates a wireless local area network, or WLAN, usually in an office or large building. An access point connects to a wired router, switch, 
or hub via an Ethernet cable, and projects a WiFi signal to a designated area.
